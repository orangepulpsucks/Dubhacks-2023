This is source code for the DubHacks 2023 hackathon.

## Getting started

1. Install dependencies in the project directory:

    ```
    npm install
    ```

2. Create a file called `keys.ts` under `src/` and export necessary keys from it

3. Run the following to start the development server:

    ```
    npm run dev
    ```

4. Open a browser and go to `localhost:5173` to see the app!

5. Type `Ctrl+C` or `q` in the terminal with the server to stop the server.
